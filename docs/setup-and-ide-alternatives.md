## Setting up  

The [supported platforms](https://swift.org/platform-support/) for running Swift on the server and the [ready-built tools packages](https://swift.org/download/) are all hosted on swift.org together with installation instructions. There you also can find the [language reference documentation](https://swift.org/documentation/).

## IDE and Swift-aware editor alternatives

There are a few different options for doing the actual coding with completions etc depending on what platform you are using, a non-exhastive list:

[Atom IDE support](https://atom.io/packages/ide-swift)

[CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/swift.html)

[Emacs plugin](https://github.com/swift-emacs/swift-mode)

[VIM plugin](https://github.com/keith/swift.vim)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

[Visual Studio Code optional code completion plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swift-development-environment)

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ide/)

## Support for other editors using LSP

Additionally, the [SourceKit-LSP project](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) has both an [extensive list of editors that supports it](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/tree/main/Editors) and instructions on how to get completion in your favourite editor.
