## Installing Swift

The [supported platforms](https://swift.org/platform-support/) for running Swift on the server and the [ready-built tools packages](https://swift.org/download/) are all hosted on swift.org together with installation instructions. There you also can find the [language reference documentation](https://swift.org/documentation/).

## Language Server Protocol (LSP) Support

The [SourceKit-LSP project](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) provides a Swift implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which provides features such as code completion and jump-to-definition in supported editors. 

The project has both an [extensive list of editors that support it](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/tree/main/Editors) and setup instructions for those editors, including many of those listed above.
